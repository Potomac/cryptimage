# cryptimage

Cryptimage is an open source software under the license GNU GPL v3 which purpose is to reproduce old analog TV encryption systems.

Systems simulated are : 

- discret 11 (used between 1984 and 1995 by french TV network "canal plus") 

- nagravision syster (used between 1995 and 2010) 

- videocrypt (used by Sky TV and by several other broadcasters on astra satellites)

This software allows to encrypt a video file (image and sound) , and allows also a decryption of an encrypted file, by meeting the standard discret11, nagravision syster and videocrypt.
Besides the ability to reproduce in a digital way these three encryption systems, its second use is to allow the re-use of hardware descramblers by injecting to them an encrypted video file produced by cryptimage.
